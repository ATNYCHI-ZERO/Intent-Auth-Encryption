IntentAuth: A Framework for Real-Time Operator Intent Verification and Cryptographic Access Control
Abstract
Traditional cryptographic access control relies on static credentials (e.g., private keys, passwords) to verify an operator's identity. This model is critically vulnerable to insider threats, credential compromise, and operator coercion. A user possessing the correct key has unrestricted access, regardless of their real-time intent.

This white paper introduces IntentAuth, a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework that fuses post-quantum-ready cryptography with real-time biometric and telemetry analysis. IntentAuth establishes an adaptive, "Zero Trust" model where access to encrypted data is contingent not just on possessing a valid key, but on the system's real-time, AI-driven verification of the operator's benign intent. This PoC demonstrates a novel "human-in-the-loop" security model where the operator's cognitive and physiological state is a component of the decryption protocol itself.

1. The Problem: The "Authorized Insider" Vulnerability
In high-consequence environments (defense, intelligence, critical infrastructure), the greatest risk is not the external attacker, but the authorized insider. An operator with valid credentials can, whether through malicious intent, coercion, or cognitive compromise, take actions that are catastrophic.

Current systems are binary: an operator is either authenticated or not. They have no mechanism to adjudicate the context of an action in real-time. If an operator is authorized to decrypt a file, they can decrypt it at any time for any purpose.

IntentAuth is designed to solve this problem by making access conditional. It asks not just "Are you who you say you are?" but also "Is your current cognitive and physiological state consistent with a benign, authorized action?"

2. System Architecture: The IntentAuth Protocol
The IntentAuth protocol is built from four primary components that work in sequence to adjudicate an access request:

The Cryptographic Core: A hybrid encryption system that creates a data "envelope." A Post-Quantum-ready Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is used to generate a shared secret, which is then bound to a Sovereign Operator Fingerprint (e.g., K-MATH::Ωv1) to derive a unique symmetric key.

The Intent Adjudication Model: A machine learning model that ingests real-time biometric and telemetry data from the operator to produce a "benign intent score" (a probability from 0.0 to 1.0).

The Dynamic Policy Engine: A logic gate that evaluates the benign intent score against a set of thresholds (e.g., ALLOW, STEPUP, DENY).

The Immutable Audit Log: A cryptographically signed, append-only log that records every event in the system for non-repudiation and future analysis.

3. Core Component Analysis
This PoC is implemented in a series of modular Python files.

3.1. The Cryptographic Core (crypto_core.py)
The core is designed to be post-quantum-ready.

Key Encapsulation (KEM): The PoC uses X25519 as a stub (a stand-in) for a true Post-Quantum KEM like Kyber or a similar algorithm. The KEMStub.encapsulate function generates a shared secret and an "encapsulated" key.

Key Derivation: The shared secret is not used directly. It is fed into an HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) along with a unique operator_fingerprint (K-MATH::Ωv1). This critical step ensures that the final symmetric key is bound not just to the session, but to the operator's sovereign identity.

Symmetric Encryption: The derived key is used with AES-GCM to encrypt the plaintext. This is a standard, authenticated encryption (AEAD) cipher.

3.2. The Intent Adjudication Model (intent_model.py)
This module is responsible for "scoring" the operator.

Input Features (Synthetic): The PoC model (dataset_generator.py) is trained on a synthetic dataset representing multi-modal biometric signals:

EEG_alpha, EEG_beta (Cognitive State)

HRV (Heart Rate Variability / Stress)

GSR_rate (Galvanic Skin Response / Arousal)

Voice_stress (Vocal Analysis)

Typing_speed (Behavioral Biometric)

Model: A lightweight Logistic Regression model is used as a stand-in for a more complex deep learning or fusion model.

Output: The model produces a "benign intent score" (1.0 = Benign, 0.0 = Malicious) and a vector of feature contributions (an explanation) for the score.

3.3. The Dynamic Policy Engine (policy_engine.py)
This module enforces the rules. It provides a more nuanced response than a simple binary.

ALLOW (e.g., Score > 0.90): The intent score is high. The system proceeds with decryption.

STEPUP (e.g., Score > 0.75): The score is ambiguous. The system could deny access or, in a production environment, trigger a "step-up" authentication (e.g., require a second operator's approval).

DENY (e.g., Score < 0.75): The score is low, indicating high stress, cognitive dissonance, or other anomalous signals. The system blocks the decryption attempt.

3.4. The Immutable Audit Log (audit_log.py)
All actions are logged for security and transparency.

Signed Events: An Ed25519 private key is used to sign every log entry.

Logged Data: The log records the action (e.g., "encrypt", "decision"), the policy_id, the score, the decision, and the explanation (feature contributions).

Non-Repudiation: This ensures that a malicious operator cannot attempt to access data and later erase the record of their failed (or successful) attempt.

4. Proof-of-Concept Demonstration Flow (demo.py)
The demo.py script executes the full end-to-end logic:

Encryption: A "receiver" key (X25519) is generated. A message is encrypted using the KEM, the K-MATH::Ωv1 operator fingerprint, and AES-GCM. The event is logged.

Benign Simulation: A benign feature vector (synthetic biometrics) is passed to the IntentModel.

The model predicts a high score (e.g., ~0.95).

The PolicyEngine evaluates this score and returns ALLOW.

The system proceeds to KEMStub.decapsulate, derives the correct key, and successfully decrypts the plaintext. The decision is logged.

Malicious Simulation: A malicious feature vector is passed to the IntentModel.

The model predicts a low score (e.g., ~0.12).

The PolicyEngine evaluates this score and returns DENY.

The decryption logic is never executed. Access is denied. The decision is logged.

Explainability (explain_intent.ipynb): A companion Jupyter notebook uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze the model. This is critical for a "Trust and Safety" workflow, allowing an auditor to understand why the AI flagged an operator's intent as malicious.

5. Future Work and Strategic Implications
This PoC establishes the viability of the IntentAuth framework. Next steps include:

PQC Integration: Replace the X25519 KEM stub with a vetted post-quantum KEM (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber) to protect against future quantum attacks.

Real Biometric Integration: Integrate the IntentModel with real hardware sensors (EEG headsets, smartwatches, microphones) to work with live operator data.

Threshold Recovery (recovery_stub.py): Implement a threshold secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's) to allow a quorum of trusted administrators (e.g., "3-of-5") to recover an encrypted envelope if the primary operator is incapacitated or compromised.

Strategically, the IntentAuth framework provides a powerful defense against the most difficult security problem: the authorized insider. It is applicable to high-consequence data, such as intelligence asset identities, nuclear launch protocols, financial clearing systems, and critical infrastructure controls.

6. Conclusion
IntentAuth represents a paradigm shift in access control, moving from a static, identity-based model to a dynamic, intent-based model. By fusing next-generation cryptography with real-time biometric adjudication, the framework addresses the critical vulnerability of the human-in-the-loop. It treats the operator's cognitive state as an active component of the security protocol, providing a granular, continuous, and auditable layer of "Zero Trust" for the most sensitive data.
